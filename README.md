# Visit Colombia 🇨🇴 [![codecov](https://codecov.io/gh/jalexisg/visit_colombia/graph/badge.svg?token=CODECOV_TOKEN)](https://codecov.io/gh/jalexisg/visit_colombia)

A modern tourism website for Colombia, built with Next.js and Tailwind CSS, consuming the [API Colombia](https://api-colombia.com/).

## Features

- **Dynamic Content**: Fetches real data for Departments, Cities, and Natural Parks from API Colombia.
- **Modern UI**: Responsive design with Tailwind CSS, custom color palette, and glassmorphism effects.
- **AI Travel Expert**: Integrated AI assistant powered by Hugging Face (Qwen 2.5), featuring anti-hallucination "Ground Truth" data for over 1,000 Colombian municipalities.
- **Auto-Navigation**: Seamlessly redirects the user to specific city pages based on the chat's destination.
- **Search**: Integrated search functionality (placeholder/client-side).
- **Monetization Ready**: Dedicated components for AdSense, Hotel affiliates, and Tour affiliates.
- **SEO Optimized**: Dynamic metadata implementation for better search engine visibility.

## Tech Stack

- **Framework**: [Next.js 14+](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router)
- **Styling**: [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- **AI Backend**: [Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces) (Python + Gradio)
- **Model**: Qwen 2.5 7B Instruct
- **Icons**: [Lucide React](https://lucide.dev/)
- **Data Source**: [API Colombia](https://api-colombia.com/)

## Getting Started

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. **Run the development server**:
   
   **Standard (local):**
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

   **Docker (Recommended for development):**
   Use the development configuration to enable real-time synchronization of code and assets via volumes:
   ```bash
   docker-compose -f docker-compose.dev.yml up -d --build
   ```
   *Note: Using this command allows images generated by AI or code changes to appear instantly without needing to rebuild or restart the container.*

3. **AI Assistant Setup**:
   The assistant runs on a Python/Gradio backend.
   - Files: `app.py` and `colombia_master.json`.
   - Data generation: Scripts located in `scripts/geo_tools/`.

## Project Structure

- `app/`: Next.js App Router pages and layouts.
- `components/`: Reusable UI components (Hero, Navbar, Card, ChatWidget, etc.).
- `lib/`: Utility functions and API client (`api.ts`).
- `scripts/`: Tools for data processing and knowledge base generation.
- `data/`: Backups and mapping files for geographic data.
- `app.py`: Main logic for the Hugging Face AI Assistant.
- `colombia_master.json`: Factual "Ground Truth" database for the AI.

## AI Assistant Architecture (Anti-Hallucination)

The assistant uses a **Hybrid Grounding** strategy to prevent geographical errors:
- **Disambiguation**: Logic that forces the AI to ask for a Department when city names repeat.
- **Fact Injection**: Mandatory regional facts (food, landmarks) are injected into the prompt based on the chosen location.
- **Auto-Navigation**: A signal protocol `[[NAV:/url]]` that triggers client-side redirection via the `ChatWidget`.
- **History Sanitizer**: The assistant "sanitizes" its own conversation history to avoid context self-confusion.

## Deployment

1. **Front-end**: Deploy to [Vercel](https://vercel.com/) by connecting your Git repository.
2. **AI Assistant**: Upload `app.py` and `colombia_master.json` to a [Hugging Face Space](https://huggingface.co/new-space) (Gradio template).
